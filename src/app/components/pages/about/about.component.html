        <p>The Users API allows to get public and private information about the authenticated user.

            Many of the resources on the users API provide a shortcut for getting information about the currently
            authenticated user. If a request URL does not include a 'username' parameter then the response will be for
            the logged in user (and you must pass authentication information with your request). Additional private
            information, such as whether a user has two-factor authentication enabled, is included when authenticated
            through basic auth or OAuth with the user scope.

            Get the authenticated user
            If the authenticated user is authenticated through basic authentication or OAuth with the user scope, then
            the response lists public and private profile information.
            <br>
            If the authenticated user is authenticated through OAuth without the user scope, then the response lists
            only public profile information.

            started making a angular app that can search for a github user by username with a component that displays
            the
            username, profile avatar, number of followers, ..., as well as a component that
            displays the user repos. ...
